🚨 SafeRide Finder: Safe Transport Point Navigation for Gauteng

Project Overview

This report proposes SafeRide Finder, a dedicated mobile application designed to address the severe transport safety deficiencies in Gauteng, particularly the high vulnerability of pedestrians navigating to public transport pickup points.

The app's core value is to transform the most dangerous part of the public transport journey—the walk to the pickup point—into the safest, utilizing localized safety data, community reporting, and low-data design principles.

The Problem Statement

The challenge is not the availability of taxis, but the fact that the digital and physical environment of transport access is hostile, unsafe, and unreliable. Users are often unable to find established, safe transport points (like taxi ranks) and are forced onto walking routes that expose them to disproportionate risks due to poor infrastructure and crime.

📊 Core Justification & Evidence (Gauteng Context)

The need for SafeRide Finder is directly aligned with findings from the Gauteng Department of Community Safety (GDCS) and related provincial reports.

1. High Pedestrian Vulnerability

Fatal Risk: Pedestrians account for nearly half of all road fatalities in Gauteng, with pedestrian deaths increasing by 48.7% between 2020 and 2021.

Gap in Intervention: While GDCS conducts Pedestrian Operations, law enforcement efforts alone are not achieving necessary reduction targets, necessitating a user-focused, proactive tool.

Design Focus: Pedestrian safety must be the primary focus of the app’s navigation, ensuring the guidance system prioritizes the safest walking route (using illumination/hazard data) over merely the nearest route.

2. Poorly Defined Routes and Infrastructure Failures

Vandalism & Visibility: Widespread vandalism of streetlights and traffic signals plunges transport corridors into darkness, creating major safety and visibility issues that make finding and reaching a transport spot impossible.

Unverified Stops: Extensive law enforcement targeting route compliance among public transport operators highlights the danger of unverified or non-compliant stops.

Safety Dissatisfaction: Households report high dissatisfaction with minibus taxis, specifically citing safety and security concerns, which the app addresses by providing confident navigation to legitimate starting points.

3. Low Digital and Data Constraints

Access Constraints: The app must be built for a market characterized by low-data, low-mobile usage, and patchy coverage.

Necessity for Offline: A user who is lost or in danger cannot afford to stream map data. The solution requires route finding and core map rendering to rely on pre-downloaded local data (Offline Mode).

Alignment with E-Policing: The app's proposed real-time safety features align with the provincial government's existing roll-out of e-policing solutions (like the e-Panic button and CCTV cameras).

✨ Proposed Core Features (Design Implications)

Based on the evidence, SafeRide Finder is designed around the following key features:

Feature

Justification / Value Proposition

Safe Path Highlighting (Screen 5)

Provides dynamic routing that guides users along the safest, best-lit paths to their destination, actively accounting for reported "dark areas" or temporary hazards.

Community Hazard Reporter (Screen 6)

Enables users to crowdsource real-time data on poor lighting, broken infrastructure, and temporary dangers, allowing the app to dynamically update the Safe Path.

Verified Transport Points

Guides users exclusively to official, legitimate, and known taxi ranks or bus stops, helping them avoid non-compliant or potentially dangerous informal stops.

Offline Mode

Ensures the core map rendering and safe route finding capabilities function reliably even in areas with patchy or low 3G/4G coverage, conserving user data.

Safety Alerts & Integration (Screen 8)

Future-proofed feature for sending safety alerts and potential integration with existing government e-policing rollouts (CCTV, e-Panic buttons) to enhance real-time response.
